"Closure Properties of Regular Languages\n\nWe show how to combine regular languages.Closure Properties\n\nA set is closed under an operation if applying that operation to any members of the set always yields a member of the set.\n\nFor example, the positive integers are closed under addition and multiplication, but not division.Closure under Kleene\n\nFact: The set of regular languages is closed under each Kleene operation. That is, if L1 and L2 are regular languages, then each of the following is also regular: L1 \u222a L2, L1L2, and L1*.Proving Closure under Kleene\n\nThe easiest approach is to show that the regular expressions (REs) for languages L1 and L2 can be combined or adjusted to form the RE for the combined language.\n\nExample: The RE for the concatenation of L1 and L2 (denoted as L1L2) is obtained by writing down the RE for L1 followed by the RE for L2.Closure under Complementation\n\nFact: The set of regular languages is closed under complementation.\n\nThe complement of a language L, written as L', consists of all strings not in L but with the same alphabet. This means that if L is a regular language, then its complement L' is also a regular language.\n\nTo understand this fact, take a deterministic finite automaton (FA) for L and interchange the accept and reject states.Closure under Intersection\nFact: The set of regular languages is closed under intersection.\nOne approach: Use de Morgan\u2019s law:\nL1 \u2229 L2 = (L1 \u222a L2)'\nand note that regular languages are closed under union and complementation.Product Construction for Intersection\n\nEach state in the product is a pair of states from the original machines.\n\nFormally, if L1 is accepted by DFA M1 with the 5-tuple (Q1, \u03a3, q1, T1, \u03b41) and L2 is accepted by DFA M2 with the 5-tuple (Q2, \u03a3, q2, T2, \u03b42), then L1 \u2229 L2 is accepted by the DFA (Q1 \u00d7 Q2, \u03a3, (q1, q2), T1 \u00d7 T2, \u03b4) where \u03b4((r, s), x) = (\u03b41(r, x), \u03b42(s, x)).Example: Even 0's and 1's\nSuppose L1 is the set of binary strings with an even number of 0's, and L2 is the set of binary strings with an even number of 1's. Then the finite automata (FA) for these languages both have two states:\n\nState A transitions:\n- On input 0, stay in State A\n- On input 1, move to State B\n\nState B transitions:\n- On input 0, move to State A\n- On input 1, stay in State B\n\nThe finite automata for L1 \u2229 L2 has four states.Product Construction for Even 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s\n\nA, X  \nA, Y  \nB, Y  \nB, X1  \n\n1  \n1  \n10  \n00  \n0  \n\nGoddard 4a: 9Overview\nA regular language is one that can be defined by a finite automaton (FA) or a regular expression (RE). Regular languages are closed under the following operations: union, concatenation, star (Kleene star), and complementation.\nGoddard 4a: 10"
