A set is closed under an operation if applying
that operation to any members of the set always
yields a member of the set.
For example, the positive integers are closed un-
der addition and multiplication, but not divi-

Fact.
The set of regular languages is closed
under complementation.
The complement of language L, written L, is all
strings not in L but with the same alphabet.
The statement says that if L is a regular lan-
guage, then so is L.
To see this fact, take deterministic FA for L
and interchange the accept and reject states.

regular language that are guaranteed to produce regular language. Closure refers to some operation on a language, resulting in a new language that is of the same “type” as originally operated on i.e., regular. Regular languages are closed under the following operations:\nConsider that L and M are regular languagesKleen Closure: RS is a regular expression whose language is L, M. R* is a regular expression whose language is L*.Positive closure: RS is a regular expression whose language is L, M.\xa0is a regular expression whose language is\xa0.Complement: The complement of a language L (with respect to an alphabet\xa0such that\xa0contains L) is\xa0–L. Since\xa0is surely regular, the complement of a regular language is always regular.Reverse Operator: Given language L,\xa0is the set of strings whose reversal is in L. Example: L = {0, 01, 100};\xa0={0, 10, 001}. Proof: Let E be a regular expression for L. We show how to reverse E, to provide a regular expression\xa0for\xa0.Union: Let L and M be the languages of regular expressions R and S, respectively.Then R+S is a regular expression whose language is(L U M).Intersection: Let L and M be the languages of regular expressions R and S, respectively then it a regular expression whose language is L intersection M. proof: Let A and B be DFA’s whose languages are L and M, respectively. Construct C, the product automaton of A and B make the final states of C be the pairs consisting of final states of both A and B.Set Difference operator: If L and M are regular languages, then so is L – M = strings in L but not M. Proof: Let A and B be DFA’s whose languages are L and M, respectively. Construct C, the product automaton of A and B make the final states of C be the pairs, where A-state is final but B-state is not.Homomorphism: A homomorphism on an alphabet is a function that gives a string for each symbol in that alphabet. Example: h(0) = ab; h(1) =\xa0. Extend to strings by h(a1…an) =h(a1)…h(an). Example: h(01010) = ababab. If L is a regular language, and h is a homomorphism on its alphabet, then h(L)= {h(w) | w is in L} is also a regular language. Proof: Let E be a regular expression for L. Apply h to each symbol in E. Language of resulting R, E is h(L).Inverse Homomorphism : Let h be a homomorphism and L a language whose alphabet is the output language of h.\xa0(L) = {w | h(w) is in L}.Note: There are few more properties like symmetric difference operator, prefix operator, substitution which are closed under closure properties of regular language. Decision Properties: Approximately all the properties are decidable in case of finite automaton.\n(i) Emptiness (ii) Non-emptiness (iii) Finiteness (iv) Infiniteness (v) Membership (vi) Equality  These are explained as following below. (i) Emptiness and Non-emptiness:\nStep-1: select the state that cannot be reached from the initial states & delete them (remove unreachable states).Step 2: if the resulting machine contains at least one final states, so then the finite automata accepts the non-empty language.Step 3: if the resulting machine is free from final state, then finite automata accepts empty language.Step-1: select the state that cannot be reached from the initial state & delete them (remove unreachable states).Step-2: select the state from which we cannot reach the final state & delete them (remove dead states).Step-3: if the resulting machine contains loops or cycles then the finite automata accepts infinite language.Step-4: if the resulting machine do not contain loops or cycles then the finite automata accepts finite language.Frequently Asked QuestionQ1. Are regular languages closed under difference?Answer:\nNo, regular languages are not closed under difference. If L1,L2 and L1-L2 may not necessarily be a regular language.\nQ2. How can closure properties be proven for regular languages?Answer:\nClosure properties for regular languages are often proven using constructions and properties of finite automata, regular expressions, or other equivalent representations. Mathematical proofs and induction are commonly employed in these demonstrations.\nQ3. Can closure properties be extended to non-regular languages?Answer:\nNo, closure properties like union, concatenation, and Kleene star are specific to regular languages. These properties do not necessarily hold for languages outside the class of regular languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n \n\nanupriyasingh317 \n\n\n\n\n\n Follow \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nNext Article\n\n\n\n\nClosure Properties of Context Free Languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar Reads\n\n\n\nRegular Expressions, Regular Grammar and Regular Languages\nAs discussed in Chomsky Hierarchy, Regular Languages are the most restricted types of languages and are accepted by finite automata.

Closure properties on regular languages are defined as certain operations on regular language that are guaranteed to produce regular language. Closure refers to some operation on a language, resulting in a new language that is of the same “type” as originally operated on i.e., regular. Regular languages are closed under the following operations:
Consider that L and M are regular languagesKleen Closure: RS is a regular expression whose language is L, M. R* is a regular expression whose language is L*.Positive closure: RS is a regular expression whose language is L, M. is a regular expression whose language is .Complement: The complement of a language L (with respect to an alphabet such that contains L) is –L. Since is surely regular, the complement of a regular language is always regular.Reverse Operator: Given language L, is the set of strings whose reversal is in L. Example: L = {0, 01, 100}; ={0, 10, 001}. Proof: Let E be a regular expression for L. We show how to reverse E, to provide a regular expression for .Union: Let L and M be the languages of regular expressions R and S, respectively.Then R+S is a regular expression whose language is(L U M).Intersection: Let L and M be the languages of regular expressions R and S, respectively then it a regular expression whose language is L intersection M. proof: Let A and B be DFA’s whose languages are L and M, respectively. Construct C, the product automaton of A and B make the final states of C be the pairs consisting of final states of both A and B.Set Difference operator: If L and M are regular languages, then so is L – M = strings in L but not M. Proof: Let A and B be DFA’s whose languages are L and M, respectively. Construct C, the product automaton of A and B make the final states of C be the pairs, where A-state is final but B-state is not.Homomorphism: A homomorphism on an alphabet is a function that gives a string for each symbol in that alphabet. Example: h(0) = ab; h(1) = . Extend to strings by h(a1…an) =h(a1)…h(an). Example: h(01010) = ababab. If L is a regular language, and h is a homomorphism on its alphabet, then h(L)= {h(w) | w is in L} is also a regular language. Proof: Let E be a regular expression for L. Apply h to each symbol in E. Language of resulting R, E is h(L).Inverse Homomorphism : Let h be a homomorphism and L a language whose alphabet is the output language of h. (L) = {w | h(w) is in L}.Note: There are few more properties like symmetric difference operator, prefix operator, substitution which are closed under closure properties of regular language. Decision Properties: Approximately all the properties are decidable in case of finite automaton.
(i) Emptiness (ii) Non-emptiness (iii) Finiteness (iv) Infiniteness (v) Membership (vi) Equality  These are explained as following below. (i) Emptiness and Non-emptiness:
Step-1: select the state that cannot be reached from the initial states & delete them (remove unreachable states).Step 2: if the resulting machine contains at least one final states, so then the finite automata accepts the non-empty language.Step 3: if the resulting machine is free from final state, then finite automata accepts empty language.Step-1: select the state that cannot be reached from the initial state & delete them (remove unreachable states).Step-2: select the state from which we cannot reach the final state & delete them (remove dead states).Step-3: if the resulting machine contains loops or cycles then the finite automata accepts infinite language.Step-4: if the resulting machine do not contain loops or cycles then the finite automata accepts finite language.Frequently Asked QuestionQ1. Are regular languages closed under difference?Answer:
No, regular languages are not closed under difference. If L1,L2 and L1-L2 may not necessarily be a regular language.
Q2. How can closure properties be proven for regular languages?Answer:
Closure properties for regular languages are often proven using constructions and properties of finite automata, regular expressions, or other equivalent representations. Mathematical proofs and induction are commonly employed in these demonstrations.
Q3. Can closure properties be extended to non-regular languages?Answer:
No, closure properties like union, concatenation, and Kleene star are specific to regular languages. These properties do not necessarily hold for languages outside the class of regular languages.

We show how to combine regular languages.Closure Properties

A set is closed under an operation if applying that operation to any members of the set always yields a member of the set.

For example, the positive integers are closed under addition and multiplication, but not division.Closure under Kleene

Fact: The set of regular languages is closed under each Kleene operation. That is, if L1 and L2 are regular languages, then each of the following is also regular: 
1. L1 ∪ L2 (union)
2. L1 L2 (concatenation)
3. L1* (Kleene star)

Goddard 4a: 3Proving Closure under Kleene

The easiest approach is to show that the regular expressions (REs) for languages L1 and L2 can be combined or adjusted to form the RE for the combination language.

Example: The RE for the concatenation of L1 and L2 (denoted as L1L2) is obtained by writing down the RE for L1 followed by the RE for L2.Closure under Complementation

Fact:
The set of regular languages is closed under complementation. The complement of a language L, written as L', consists of all strings not in L but using the same alphabet. This means that if L is a regular language, then L' is also a regular language.

To understand this fact, consider a deterministic finite automaton (FA) for L and interchange the accept and reject states.Closure under Intersection

Fact:
The set of regular languages is closed under intersection.

One approach: Use de Morgan’s law:
L1 ∩ L2 = (L1 ∪ L2)'

It follows that regular languages are closed under union and complementation.Product Construction for Intersection
Each state in the product is a pair of states from the original machines.
Formally, if L1 is accepted by DFA M1 with 5-tuple (Q1, Σ, q1, T1, δ1) and L2 is accepted by DFA M2 with 5-tuple (Q2, Σ, q2, T2, δ2), then L1 ∩ L2 is accepted by the DFA (Q1 × Q2, Σ, (q1, q2), T1 × T2, δ) where δ((r, s), x) = (δ1(r, x), δ2(s, x)).Example: Even 0’s and 1’s
Suppose L1 is the set of binary strings with an even number of 0’s, and L2 is the set of binary strings with an even number of 1’s. The finite automata (FAs) for these languages both have two states:

States: A, B
Transitions:
- From A:
  - On input 1, stay in A
  - On input 0, go to B
- From B:
  - On input 1, go to A
  - On input 0, stay in B

Thus, the finite automata for the intersection L1 ∩ L2 has four states.Product Construction for Even 0’s and 1’s

Goddard 4a: 9Overview
A regular language is one which has a finite automaton (FA) or a regular expression (RE). Regular languages are closed under the following operations: union, concatenation, star (Kleene star), and complementation.Closure Properties of Regular Languages

Closure properties of regular languages are defined as operations on regular languages that guarantee the production of another regular language. Closure refers to an operation on a language resulting in a new language that is of the same type, specifically regular.

Regular languages are closed under the following operations:

1. **Kleen Closure**: If L is a regular language, then L* (Kleen star) is also a regular language. 

2. **Positive Closure**: If L is a regular language, then L+ (positive closure) is also a regular language. 

3. **Complement**: The complement of a language L (with respect to an alphabet that contains L) is denoted as -L. Since the complement of a regular language is always regular, this closure property holds. 

4. **Reverse Operator**: Given a language L, the reverse of L, denoted as L^R, is the set of strings whose reversal is in L. For example, if L = {0, 01, 100}, then L^R = {0, 10, 001}. Proof: Let E be a regular expression for L. We can reverse E to provide a regular expression for L^R.

5. **Union**: Let L and M be the languages of regular expressions R and S, respectively. Then R + S is a regular expression whose language is (L ∪ M).

6. **Intersection**: Let L and M be the languages of regular expressions R and S, respectively. Then the intersection L ∩ M is a regular language. Proof: Let A and B be DFAs (Deterministic Finite Automata) whose languages are L and M, respectively. Construct C, the product automaton of A and B, and make the final states of C be the pairs consisting of final states of both A and B.

7. **Set Difference**: If L and M are regular languages, then L - M (the set of strings in L but not in M) is also a regular language. Proof: Let A and B be DFAs whose languages are L and M, respectively. Construct C, the product automaton of A and B, and make the final states of C be the pairs where A-state is final but B-state is not.

8. **Homomorphism**: A homomorphism on an alphabet is a function that maps each symbol in that alphabet to a string. For example, h(0) = ab; h(1) = ε (empty string). It can be extended to strings by h(a1...an) = h(a1)...h(an). If L is a regular language, and h is a homomorphism on its alphabet, then h(L) = {h(w) | w is in L} is also a regular language. Proof: Let E be a regular expression for L. Apply h to each symbol in E to obtain regular expression R, where the language of R is h(L).

9. **Inverse Homomorphism**: Let h be a homomorphism and L a language whose alphabet is the output language of h. The inverse homomorphism h^(-1)(L) = {w | h(w) is in L}.

Note: There are additional properties such as symmetric difference operator, prefix operator, and substitution that are also closed under the closure properties of regular languages.

**Decision Properties**: Most properties concerning regular languages are decidable in the case of finite automata, including:
1. Emptiness
2. Non-emptiness
3. Finiteness
4. Infiniteness
5. Membership
6. Equality

These are explained as follows:
- **Emptiness and Non-emptiness**:
  - Step 1: Select states that cannot be reached from the initial states and delete them (remove unreachable states).
  - Step 2: If the resulting machine contains at least one final state, the finite automaton accepts a non-empty language.
  - Step 3: If the resulting machine is free from final states, the finite automaton accepts an empty language.

- **Finiteness and Infiniteness**:
  - Step 1: Select states that cannot be reached from the initial state and delete them (remove unreachable states).
  - Step 2: Select states from which we cannot reach the final state and delete them (remove dead states).
  - Step 3: If the resulting machine contains loops or cycles, the finite automaton accepts an infinite language.
  - Step 4: If the resulting machine does not contain loops or cycles, the finite automaton accepts a finite language.

**Frequently Asked Questions**
1. **Are regular languages closed under difference?**
   Answer: No, regular languages are not closed under difference. If L1 and L2 are regular languages, L1 - L2 may not necessarily be a regular language.

2. **How can closure properties be proven for regular languages?**
   Answer: Closure properties for regular languages are often proven using constructions and properties of finite automata, regular expressions, or other equivalent representations. Mathematical proofs and induction are commonly employed in these demonstrations.

3. **Can closure properties be extended to non-regular languages?**
   Answer: No, closure properties such as union, concatenation, and Kleene star are specific to regular languages. These properties do not necessarily hold for languages outside the class of regular languages.
